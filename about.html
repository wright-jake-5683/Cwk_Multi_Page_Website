                <h2>About the Band</h2>
                <p>
                    The Jimi Hendix Experience was started by world famous guitarist Jimi Hendrix. 
                    Jimi was born in Seattle, Washington and grew up in the poorest part of the city. 
                    He slowly taught himself to play electric guitar and knew it was his passion. He then moved to Portland, 
                    Oregon where he spent several months homeless as he tried to launch his music career. Jimi Hendrix formed his band in 1966, 
                    when he went on his first tour in the UK, where he met his band mates Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell. 
                    They were one of the most famous bands in the world and did collaborations with The Beatles.

                <h2>Why I Like It</h2>
                <p>
                    I like Jimi Hendrix and The Jimi Hendrix Experience because of the sheer amount of talent! When Jimi Hendrix was alive, 
                    he did not have access to computer editing, so he used very unique and creative ways to come up with new sounds. 
                    He also improvised so much that no two shows were the same, sometimes he would improvise a whole new song. 
                    <b>Not only did he play guitar, but he was the lead vocalist too!!</b> 
                    He was a very peaceful and kind person who loved to make beautiful music for others to enjoy.
